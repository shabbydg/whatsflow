## Bug Fixes Applied

### Issue 1: Broadcast Worker Import Error
**Problem:** `whatsappService` export not found
**Fix:** Changed worker to import `WhatsAppService` class and create instance, uses `sendMessage()` method

### Issue 2: Frontend Axios Import Error
**Problem:** `import { api } from './axios'` - file doesn't exist
**Fix:** Created axios instance directly in `broadcasts.ts` and `create/page.tsx` with token interceptors

### Issue 3: Auth Middleware Type Issues
**Problem:** Routes accessing `(req as any).businessProfileId` causing 500 errors
**Fix:**
- Exported `AuthRequest` type from auth middleware
- Updated all route handlers to use `AuthRequest` instead of `Request`
- Changed access pattern to `req.user?.businessProfileId`
- Added validation checks for undefined businessProfileId/userId

## Known Limitations

1. **CSV Format:** Simple parser, may fail on complex CSV formats
2. **Media Upload:** Currently only supports text messages via worker (media URLs not implemented in sendMessage flow)
3. **Duplicate Detection:** Only deduplicates within same broadcast
4. **Error Recovery:** Failed messages not automatically retried
5. **Large Lists:** UI may be slow with >1000 contacts per list
6. **Timezone:** All times in server timezone

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Features:**
   - Message templates library
   - A/B testing
   - Analytics dashboard
   - Export reports (CSV, PDF)

2. **Media Handling:**
   - Upload media files
   - Image/video preview
   - Media library

3. **Contact Management:**
   - Import from Excel
   - Contact segmentation
   - Tag-based filtering
   - Duplicate detection across lists

4. **Scheduling:**
   - Recurring broadcasts
   - Timezone selection
   - Smart send times

5. **Compliance:**
   - Opt-out link in messages
   - Compliance reports
   - Audit logs
   - Rate limit warnings

6. **Performance:**
   - Redis-based queue (Bull)
   - Worker scaling
   - Database optimization
   - Pagination improvements
