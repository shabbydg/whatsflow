### Step 2: DNS Setup (15 minutes)

In your DNS manager for `digitalarc.lk`, add:

**Wait 5-10 minutes** for DNS to propagate.

**Test:**
```bash
nslookup whatsflow.digitalarc.lk
# Should return your server IP
```

---

### Step 3: Run Automated Setup (30 minutes)

**SSH into your server:**
```bash
ssh root@YOUR_SERVER_IP
```

**Create user:**
```bash
adduser whatsflow
usermod -aG sudo whatsflow
su - whatsflow
```

**Clone your repo:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shabbydg/whatsflow.git
cd whatsflow
```

**Run automated installer:**
```bash
bash scripts/deploy-single-server.sh
```

This installs:
- Node.js
- MySQL
- Redis
- Nginx
- PM2
- Certbot

---

### Step 4: Configure Applications (45 minutes)

**Set up database:**
```bash
bash scripts/setup-database.sh

cd ~/whatsflow/whatsflow/backend
nano .env
# Copy configuration from SINGLE_SERVER_DEPLOYMENT.md
```

**Configure frontend apps:**
```bash
# Main app
cd ~/whatsflow/frontend
nano .env.local

# Admin panel
cd ~/whatsflow/admin
nano .env.local
```

---

### Step 5: Start Everything (15 minutes)

**Build and start all apps:**
```bash
bash scripts/start-production.sh
```

**Check status:**
```bash
pm2 status
# All 4 apps should show "online"
```

---

### Step 6: Configure Nginx (20 minutes)

**Create Nginx config:**
```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/whatsflow
# Copy configuration from SINGLE_SERVER_DEPLOYMENT.md
```

**Enable site:**
```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/whatsflow /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

---

### Step 7: SSL Certificates (10 minutes)

**Get certificates:**
```bash
sudo certbot --nginx \
  -d whatsflow.digitalarc.lk \
  -d app.whatsflow.digitalarc.lk \
  -d admin.whatsflow.digitalarc.lk \
  -d api.whatsflow.digitalarc.lk
```

**Follow prompts:**
- Enter email
- Agree to terms
- Choose: Redirect HTTP to HTTPS

---

### Step 8: Test Everything (15 minutes)
